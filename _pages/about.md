I'm PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering from UC Santa Barbara, advised by [Peng Li](https://web.ece.ucsb.edu/~lip/). Before that, I received my M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, advised by [David Blaauw](https://blaauw.engin.umich.edu/) and [Dennis Sylvester](https://sylvester.engin.umich.edu/), and B.S. in Electronic Engineering from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, advised by [Bei Yu](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~byu/) and [Udo Schwingenschl√∂gl](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/study/faculty/udo-schwingenschlogl).

My interest lies in the intersection of machine learning and computer architecture. Specifically, bio-inspired machine learning algorithms and efficient ML/LLM computing systems.
